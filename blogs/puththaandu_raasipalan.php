The term "Rasipalan" translates to "astrological predictions" in Tamil, indicating its role as a guiding light for individuals seeking to navigate the complexities of life. The practice of Rasipalan dates back centuries, with its origins believed to be traced to the Sangam period, an era known for its rich literary and cultural contributions to Tamil society.</p>
