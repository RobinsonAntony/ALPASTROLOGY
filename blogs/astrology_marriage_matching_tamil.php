                <br />
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom_a20 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1. Nakshatra Matching: </b> Nakshatras, or lunar mansions, play a central role in astrology marriage matching. Each individual is born under a specific nakshatra, which is associated with unique characteristics and qualities. Compatibility between partners' nakshatras is assessed to ensure alignment in temperament, values, and life goals.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom_a20 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2. Rasi Matching:</b>  Rasi, or zodiac sign, compatibility is another crucial aspect of astrology marriage matching. The positioning of the Moon in each partner's horoscope determines their rasi, which influences emotional compatibility and familial harmony. Matching compatible rasis is believed to foster mutual understanding and emotional resonance between partners.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom_a20 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3. Guna Milan: </b> Guna Milan, also known as "Ashtakoota" matching, involves assessing the compatibility of various attributes, known as gunas, between partners' horoscopes. These gunas include qualities such as intellect, spirituality, and physical attraction, among others. A higher number of matching gunas indicates greater compatibility and potential for marital bliss.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom_a20 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>4. Dosha Analysis:</b> Astrology marriage matching also considers doshas, or malefic influences, present in the birth charts of prospective partners. Doshas such as Mangal Dosha (Mars affliction) or Nadi Dosha (compatibility of nadi, or pulse) may indicate potential challenges or obstacles in marriage. Remedies and precautions are prescribed to mitigate the effects of doshas and ensure a harmonious union.</p>
