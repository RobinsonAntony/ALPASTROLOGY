                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> English horoscopes are based on the principles of Western astrology, which divides the celestial sphere into twelve zodiac signs, each associated with specific personality traits, strengths, and challenges. The sun sign, determined by the position of the sun at the time of birth, serves as the primary focus of most horoscopes.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom50 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Horoscopes typically provide daily, weekly, or monthly forecasts for each zodiac sign, offering insights into themes such as love, career, health, and personal growth. Astrologers interpret the planetary movements and alignments to forecast potential opportunities, challenges, and trends in various areas of life.</p>
