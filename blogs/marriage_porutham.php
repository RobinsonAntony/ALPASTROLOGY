                    <div class="as_paragraph_wrapper">
                        
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Marriage Porutham is based on the principles of Vedic astrology, which views the cosmos as an interconnected web of energies and influences that shape human destinies. The compatibility of prospective partners is assessed by examining various factors in their respective horoscopes, including:</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1. Nakshatras (Lunar Constellations):</b> Nakshatras play a crucial role in Marriage Porutham, as they represent the cosmic energies and qualities that influence an individual's personality, temperament, and life path. Compatibility between the nakshatras of the bride and groom is assessed to determine their emotional, mental, and spiritual compatibility.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2. Guna Milan (Matching of Qualities): </b>  Guna Milan is a key component of Marriage Porutham, wherein the horoscopes of the bride and groom are evaluated based on 36 "gunas" or qualities. These gunas are assigned points based on compatibility factors such as temperament, character, and lifestyle. A higher score indicates greater compatibility between the couple.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3. Doshas (Afflictions): </b> In Vedic astrology, certain planetary combinations and placements may create doshas or afflictions in the horoscope, which can affect marital compatibility and harmony. Common doshas include "Mangal Dosha" (Mars affliction), "Kuja Dosha," and "Nadi Dosha." Remedies and precautions are prescribed to mitigate the effects of doshas and ensure a successful marriage.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>4. Planetary Positions and Aspects:</b> Astrologers analyze the positions and aspects of planets in the couple's horoscopes to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of conflict. Benefic planets and harmonious aspects between planets are considered favorable for marital bliss, while malefic planets and challenging aspects may indicate areas of concern.</p>
