Transits:</b> Transits occur when planets in the sky form geometric angles (aspects) to planets in an individual's birth chart.

                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">While astrology offers valuable insights into potential trends and energies, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations in predicting specific events or outcomes with precision. Several factors contribute to these limitations, including:</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1. Free Will: </b>Human beings possess free will and the ability to make choices that influence the course of their lives. Astrology can indicate potential opportunities and challenges, but individual decisions ultimately shape how these energies manifest.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2. Complexity of Life:</b>Life is multifaceted and influenced by numerous factors beyond astrological symbolism, including cultural, social, and environmental dynamics. Astrology provides a symbolic language for interpreting these complexities, but it cannot account for every nuance or variable.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3. Interpretation and Subjectivity:</b>Astrological interpretation involves subjective judgment and intuition, as astrologers synthesize symbolic imagery and archetypal themes to derive meaning. Different astrologers may offer varying interpretations of the same astrological configurations, adding complexity to prediction.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop10 revealy"> <b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> Astrology's role in future prediction is a nuanced and complex endeavor that offers valuable insights into potential trends, energies, and developments. While astrology may not provide definitive predictions of specific events, it offers a symbolic language for understanding the dynamics of life and navigating its uncertainties with wisdom and grace. By embracing astrology as a tool for self-discovery, empowerment, and growth, individuals can unlock the transformative power of the cosmos and embark on a journey of deeper understanding and fulfillment.</p>
