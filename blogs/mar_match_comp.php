                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1. Guna Milan: </b> In Vedic astrology, marriage match compatibility is primarily assessed through Guna Milan, a system that assigns points to various factors based on the alignment of lunar constellations (Nakshatras) in the birth charts of both partners. The total score indicates the level of compatibility between the couple, with higher scores indicating greater harmony.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2. Nakshatra Compatibility:</b> The position of the Moon in the birth chart, particularly its placement in specific Nakshatras, plays a significant role in marriage match compatibility. Certain Nakshatras are considered compatible, while others may indicate potential challenges or conflicts in the relationship.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3. Planetary Alignment:</b> Astrologers also analyze the positions of other planets, such as Venus (representing love and romance), Mars (indicative of passion and assertiveness), and Jupiter (reflecting shared beliefs and values), to assess compatibility between partners. The interactions between these celestial bodies offer insights into relationship dynamics and potential areas of harmony or discord.</p>
