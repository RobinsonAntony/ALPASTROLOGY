                    <div class="as_paragraph_wrapper">
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> Thirumana Porutham evaluates various astrological factors in the horoscopes of the prospective bride and groom to assess their compatibility and suitability for marriage. Some of the key factors considered in Thirumana Porutham include:</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1. Nakshatras (Lunar Constellations):</b> Nakshatras play a significant role in Thirumana Porutham, representing the cosmic energies and qualities that influence an individual's personality, temperament, and destiny. Compatibility between the nakshatras of the bride and groom is assessed to determine their emotional, mental, and spiritual compatibility.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2. Guna Milan (Matching of Qualities): </b> Guna Milan is a fundamental aspect of Thirumana Porutham, wherein the horoscopes of the bride and groom are evaluated based on 36 "gunas" or qualities. These qualities include factors such as temperament, character, and lifestyle, with each guna assigned points depending on compatibility. A higher total score indicates greater compatibility between the couple.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3. Doshas (Afflictions):</b> Doshas or planetary afflictions in the horoscope can indicate potential challenges or obstacles in marriage. Common doshas evaluated in Thirumana Porutham include "Mangal Dosha" (Mars affliction), "Kuja Dosha," and "Nadi Dosha." Remedies and precautions are prescribed to mitigate the effects of doshas and ensure a successful marriage.</p>
                        <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>4. Planetary Positions and Aspects:</b> Astrologers analyze the positions and aspects of planets in the couple's horoscopes to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of conflict. Benefic planets and harmonious aspects between planets are considered favorable for marital bliss, while malefic planets and challenging aspects may indicate areas of concern.</p>
