                <br />
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">The process of calculating Akshaya Lagna involves intricate mathematical calculations and astrological techniques. While the methodology may vary slightly among practitioners, the underlying principle remains consistent: to identify moments of perpetual auspiciousness. Factors such as the Ascendant's sign, degree, and Nakshatra (lunar mansion) play a crucial role in determining Akshaya Lagna. Additionally, practitioners consider planetary positions, aspects, and dignities to refine their analysis and pinpoint auspicious timings with precision.</p>
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Akshaya Tritiya, also known as Akha Teej, is a highly auspicious day in Hindu culture and is considered one of the most favorable days for beginning new ventures, investments, and marriages. Akshaya Tritiya falls on the third lunar day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of the Indian lunar month of Vaishakha (Aprilâ€“May). One of the significant practices associated with Akshaya Tritiya is calculating Akshaya Lagna.</p>
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Akshaya Lagna is considered an exceptionally auspicious time on Akshaya Tritiya for beginning new endeavors, investments, or any important activities. It is believed that any actions initiated during this time are likely to bring long-lasting prosperity and success.</p>
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">To calculate Akshaya Lagna, one must consider the positions of the Sun and Moon during that particular day. The specific time when the Sun is in the exalted sign of Aries (Mesha) and the Moon is in the exalted sign of Taurus (Vrishabha) is considered the Akshaya Lagna. This usually occurs during the early hours of the morning, and it's considered crucial to start new ventures or activities during this period to ensure their success and prosperity.</p>
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">While calculating Akshaya Lagna, it's essential to consult Hindu calendars or Panchangam, which provide detailed information about planetary positions, nakshatras (lunar constellations), and auspicious timings for various activities. Many people also seek guidance from astrologers to determine the most favorable timing for starting significant ventures or investments on Akshaya Tritiya.</p>
                <p class="as_margin0 as_font14 as_padderBottom10 revealx" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Overall, calculating Akshaya Lagna is a practice deeply rooted in Hindu tradition, believed to harness the cosmic energies of this auspicious day for initiating endeavors that promise everlasting success and prosperity.</p>
