                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> Astrology, known as "Jyotish Shastra" in Sanskrit, has a history that dates back thousands of years in India. The origins of Indian astrology can be traced to the Vedas, ancient texts dating back to around 1500 BCE, which contain references to celestial phenomena and their influence on human life.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom50 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">The Vedas laid the foundation for the development of various branches of astrology, including Hora Shastra (astrology), Ganita Shastra (mathematics), and Samhita Shastra (mundane astrology). Over time, astrology became intricately woven into Indian culture and society, influencing everything from personal decisions to statecraft and governance.</p>
