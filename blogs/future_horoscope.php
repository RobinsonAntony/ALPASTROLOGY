Transits:</b>  Transits are the movements of the planets as they travel through the zodiac, forming aspects to the planets in an individual's birth chart. Future horoscopes analyze the upcoming planetary transits to identify significant events, shifts, and developments in various areas of life, such as relationships, career, finances, and personal growth.
