                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Astrology is the study of the positions and movements of celestial bodies, such as planets and stars, and their influence on human affairs and natural phenomena. It is based on the principle that the cosmos is interconnected, and that the alignment of celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth can reveal insights into their personality, behavior, and life path.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop20 as_padderBottom50 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Horoscopes, on the other hand, are astrological predictions based on an individual's birth chart, also known as a natal chart or horoscope. These predictions offer guidance and insights into various aspects of life, including relationships, career, health, and personal development. Horoscopes are typically divided into twelve astrological signs, each representing a different segment of the zodiac based on the position of the Sun at the time of birth.</p>
