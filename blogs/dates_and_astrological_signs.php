                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> The zodiac is divided into twelve signs, each representing different personality traits, tendencies, and energies.

Rising signs, also known as the ascendant, reflect the mask we wear and how we present ourselves to the world. Moon signs illuminate our emotional landscape, revealing our innermost feelings, instincts, and needs. By examining the interplay between these various components, astrologers can paint a more nuanced portrait of an individual's personality.</p>
