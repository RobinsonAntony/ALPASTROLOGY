                </div>

                 <h5 class="as_font14 revealy">Welcome to the fascinating world of ALP Astrology </h5>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy"> ALP is known as Akshaya Lagna Paddhati or Age Lagna Paddhati.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
                        ALP Astrology invites you to explore the rich reservoir of traditional astrological wisdom, empowering you to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and gain a profound insight into your inner self, life's journey, and the surrounding world.
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> Traditionally, astrology encompasses various contemporary concepts and employs effective tools and methodologies to deliver accurate predictions in a timely manner. Among the commonly utilized methods are DASA and BUKTHI, based on the moon and its associated star. While these methods yield significant predictions, they may not fully capture the essence of LAGNA or ASCENDANT. Therefore, there is a specific emphasis on enhancing predictive astrology by assigning due importance to the Lagna.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> This innovative approach stems from the vision of Dr. S. Pothuvudaimoorthy, who dedicated considerable time and effort to researching and refining this concept to meet the evolving needs of an accurate extrapolative system. Through independent research, Dr. Pothuvudaimoorthy has determined the precise speed at which the Lagna travelsâ€”covering one Nakshatra Pada in one year, one month, and ten days. Over the course of its journey, the Lagna experiences ten years to traverse one zodiac sign, comprehensively spanning 120 years of an individual's life, akin to the VIMSHOTTARI DASA system.</p>

                 <p class="as_font14 as_padderTop10 revealy"> <b>ALP ASTROLOGY - MARRIAGE MATCHING/COMPATIBILITY</b></p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">If you are in the process of seeking a marriage alliance for your child and wondering whether to use an old childhood photo or a recent one, this book is tailored for you. </p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>Marriage: An ancient tradition</b></p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Marriage transcends the connection between two individuals and their hearts; it marks the commencement of a lineage that persists for centuries. The significance of seeking a horoscopic match reflects the acknowledgment that marriage is likened to 'a thousand-year crop,' underscoring its profound impact and enduring legacy. </p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>Lost time is never found again:</b></p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">In the natural world, all creatures instinctively seek their pair at the right time, effortlessly and without external assistance. However, for human beings endowed with six senses, marriage holds a significance beyond mere companionship. It forms the bedrock of family life, serving as the cornerstone of our civilization. Beyond the basic instincts of reproduction and proliferation, marriage is rooted in the noble ideal of lineage.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Marriage, within the context of human society, has evolved into the commencement of a lifelong journey rather than a momentary satisfaction. Recognizing the immense responsibility that comes with this institution, the Akshaya Lagna Paddathi (ALP) methodology is crafted as a tool to accurately reflect the current time period. ALP serves as a guide in navigating the complexities of human relationships within the broader framework of marriage and family life. </p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>Things to note before considering a marriage match</b></p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">In the ALP methodology, the process of matching horoscopes involves aligning specific aspects. It necessitates a match in the ALP lagna of the prospective bride and groom, as well as a correspondence in the Akshaya rasi and Dasha bukthi of both individuals. The primary objective is to elucidate the fate and karma of an individual based on their horoscope, offering insight to the prospective couple and their parents. This includes explaining any delays in marriage and providing an understanding of the potential life partner based on the individual's horoscope.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">The key advantage of this approach is to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their marriage life before entering into the marital bond. By focusing on horoscopic predictions, the ALP methodology aims to steer individuals away from unreasonable expectations that may lead to dismissing favorable matches for trivial reasons. Such dismissals can result in unnecessary delays and, eventually, acceptance of less favorable matches.</p>
                <p class="as_font14 revealy" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">To counter this, the Akshaya Lagna Paddathi is committed to guiding individuals in selecting the right match based on their horoscope, preventing avoidable delays and hurdles in the marriage process. The overarching goal of ALP is rooted in a noble ideology, striving to enhance people's lives by providing clarity, assisting in overcoming obstacles, and alleviating sorrows related to marriage concerns.</p>
